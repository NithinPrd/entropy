# Voting System
## Purpose
The aim of this project is to implement a secure voting system using blockchain. I'm working on this primarily to understand blockchain as a concept.

Backend is my current focus for the project. I aim to have a tight backend logic in place before I start working on any UI/website.

Also trying to get a hand of django/python in the meantime (have been working on python for ~1 year now? Not confident still ðŸ˜›)

Setting up goals and learnings in separate docs.

Minor objective: Learn deployment process and a bit of terraform
