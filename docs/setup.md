# Setup

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have django installed. I will try to containerize the project in the coming future, but it'll be a bit hacky to run till then.

Run the following commands:
```
cd voting

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Will update with progress.
